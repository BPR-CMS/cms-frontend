This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

### Node.js

Next.js requires Node.js to run. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime.

- **Download & Install Node.js**: Visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install the latest stable version of Node.js. This installation will also include npm (Node Package Manager), which is essential for managing dependencies in the project.

### npm (Node Package Manager)

npm is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.

- **Verify Installation**: To check that you have Node.js and npm installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

`node -v`

`npm -v`

## Setting Up the Project

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can set up the project on your local machine.

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git.

git clone <https://github.com/BPR-CMS/cms-frontend.git>

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies.

cd cms-frontend

npm install


3. **Running the Project**: After successfully installing the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:

npm run dev

This will start the Next.js development server, and you can view your application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
